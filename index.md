## Overview

Manoa Bites is a web application designed to help students and staff at the University of Hawaii at Manoa easily find food options across campus locations.

* **Campus-wide Food Directory**: Consolidates food options from Campus Center, food trucks, Manoa Gardens, and other campus locations.
* **Real-time Updates**: Vendors can log in to update daily menus, ensuring users always see current options.
* **Personalized Experience**: Users can set food preferences and get suggestions tailored to their tastes.
* **Roles**: Three user roles (Users, Vendors, and Admins) for personalized and manageable access.
