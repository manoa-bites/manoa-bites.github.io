## Overview

Manoa Bites is a web application designed to help students and staff at the University of Hawaii at Manoa easily find food options across campus locations. With Manoa Bites, users can discover available menu items, search for specific restraurants, and find out which dishes are being served on any given day. Key features include:

* **Campus-wide Food Directory**: Consolidates food options from Campus Center, food trucks, Manoa Gardens, and other campus locations.
* **Real-time Updates**: Vendors can log in to update daily menus, ensuring users always see current options.
* **Personalized Experience**: Users can set food preferences and get suggestions tailored to their tastes.
* **Roles**: Three user roles (Users, Vendors, and Admins) for personalized and manageable access.

### Landing Page/Directory

<img width="100%" src="assets/landingpage.png" alt="Current Landing Page">

The landing page of Manoa Bites brings up this page where they are already presented with cards displaying restaurants and their restaurants. We are currently in the middle of testing the functions to add/edit restaurants so our images are not fully uploaded yet. We also added a search bar that has zero functionality yet that we hope to get finished in M3.

### Search Bar on LandingPage/Directory

<img width="100%" src="assets/searchbar.png" alt="Current Landing Page">

The search bar found on the landing page allows users to sort through the restaurants by name in ascending and descending order and by location on campus. This feature can be accessed throught the sort dropdown. Users can also for a specific restaurant by utilizing the form that displays "Search for a Restaurant."


### Map Page

<img width="100%" src="assets/mappage.png" alt="Current Map Page">

The Map index page is available to preview without having to log-in and displays an interactive Map centered at UH Manoa's Campus. There are markers here that make the locations easy to find. The initial markers just mark the main locations on UH Manoa's Campus. The drop down selection will load the marker for the selected restaurant.

## Developer Guide

This section provides information of interest to Meteor developers who wish to contribute to Manoa Bites or use this as a template for their own development tasks.

### Installation

First, [install PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/). Then create a database for your application.

```

$ createdb manoabites
Password:
$

```

Second, go to [https://github.com/manoa-bites/manoa-bites](https://github.com/manoa-bites/manoa-bites), and click on the "Code" button and select the "Use this template" button. Complete the dialog box to create a new repository that you own that is initialized with this template's files.

Third, go to your newly created repository, and click the "Clone or download" button to download your new GitHub repo to your local file system. Using [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) is a great choice if you use MacOS or Windows.

Fourth, cd into the directory of your local copy of the repo, and install third party libraries with:

```

$ npm install

```

Fifth, create a `.env` file from the `sample.env`. Set the `DATABASE_URL` variable to match your PostgreSQL database that you created in the first step. See the Prisma docs [Connect your database](https://www.prisma.io/docs/getting-started/setup-prisma/add-to-existing-project/relational-databases/connect-your-database-typescript-postgresql). Then run the Prisma migration `npx prisma migrate dev` to set up the PostgreSQL tables.

```

$ npx prisma migrate dev
Environment variables loaded from .env
Prisma schema loaded from prisma/schema.prisma
Datasource "db": PostgreSQL database "<your database name>", schema "public" at "localhost:5432"

Applying migration `20240708195109_init`

The following migration(s) have been applied:

migrations/
â””â”€ 20240708195109_init/
â””â”€ migration.sql

Your database is now in sync with your schema.

âœ” Generated Prisma Client (v5.16.1) to ./node_modules/@prisma/client in 51ms

$

```

Then seed the database with the `/config/settings.development.json` data using `npx prisma db seed`.

```

$ npx prisma db seed
Environment variables loaded from .env
Running seed command `ts-node --compiler-options {"module":"CommonJS"} prisma/seed.ts` ...
Seeding the database
Creating user: admin@foo.com with role: ADMIN
Creating user: john@foo.com with role: USER

ðŸŒ± The seed command has been executed.
$

```

## Running the system

Once the libraries are installed and the database seeded, you can run the application by invoking the "dev" script in the [package.json file](https://github.com/ics-software-engineering/nextjs-application-template/blob/master/app/package.json):

```

$ npm run dev

> nextjs-application-template-1@0.1.0 dev
> next dev

â–² Next.js 14.2.4

- Local: http://localhost:3000
- Environments: .env

âœ“ Starting...
âœ“ Ready in 1619ms

```

### Viewing the running app

If all goes well, the template application will appear at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). You can login using the credentials in [settings.development.json](https://github.com/ics-software-engineering/nextjs-application-template/blob/main/config/settings.development.json), or else register a new account.

### ESLint

You can verify that the code obeys our coding standards by running ESLint over the code in the src/ directory with:

```
$ npm run lint

> nextjs-application-template-1@0.1.0 lint
> next lint

âœ” No ESLint warnings or errors
$
```

## Development History

### Milestone #1: Rough drafts

<a href="https://github.com/orgs/manoa-bites/projects/2">Here is the link to our M1 project page.</a>

For this Milestone, we primarily focused on setting up simple database models and pages/components. We have completed implementing the majority of our pages.

<img width="100%" src="assets/m1backlog.png" alt="M1 done">

### Milestone #2: Refinement

<a href="https://github.com/orgs/manoa-bites/projects/4">Here is the link to our M2 project page.</a>

In this upcoming Milestone we plan to add more information and functionality to our page. With our restaurant cards we aim to add more information about the restaurant(i.e. an image/logo, hours of operations, and brief description). Also we still need to make the favorites button on the restaurant card functional where it will save it to the Users favorites. 

<img width="100%" src="assets/m2backlog.png" alt="M2 done">

### Milestone #3: Finishing Touches

<a href="https://github.com/orgs/manoa-bites/projects/6/views/1">Here is the link to our M3 project page.</a>

In this Milestone we added a bit more functionality to the admin page and search bar. We then started adding real data into our database to reflect real restaurants on campus.

## Continuous Integration

[![manoabites-application-template](https://github.com/manoa-bites/manoa-bites/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg?label=ci-manoabites)](https://github.com/manoa-bites/manoa-bites/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

Manoa Bites uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration, ensuring code quality and passing tests on every commit. You can see the results of all recent "workflows" at <a href="https://github.com/manoa-bites/manoa-bites/actions">https://github.com/manoa-bites/manoa-bites/actions</a>.


## Example Enhancements

Enhancements that could further improve Manoa Bites include:

* Adding notifications for when favorite items are available.
* Allowing users to filter menus by dietary preferences (e.g., vegan, gluten-free).
* Enabling a feedback system for users to rate menu items.
* Having a search bar in the google map on the Maps tab.
