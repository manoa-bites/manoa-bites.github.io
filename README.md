# Manoa-Bites

**Overview**  
Manoa Bites is a campus-friendly app designed to make finding specific food types on the University of Hawaii at Manoa campus easier. With numerous food options on campus—from Campus Center and food trucks to vending machines and Paradise Palms—it can be hard to know who’s serving what, especially if you’re craving something specific, like Chinese food, or hoping to catch a particular dish like the fresh salmon fillet at Campus Center.

**The Problem**  
There are a lot of food choices across campus, but finding exactly what you want can be challenging. Whether you’re looking for a particular cuisine, a specific menu item, or simply curious about what’s available at the moment, navigating these options can be time-consuming and frustrating.

**The Solution**  
The Manoa Bites app provides a consolidated directory of food choices across campus locations. Through Manoa Bites, users can log in to:

- Find specific menu items available at campus locations today.
- See what food is available right now.
- Discover when their preferred food styles are available today.

**Roles in the App**  
Manoa Bites organizes its features around three user roles:

1. **Users**: Can log in to set preferences, filter food choices, and receive personalized suggestions.
2. **Vendors**: Can log in to update their menus daily and manage their profile information.
3. **Admins**: Can manage user roles and oversee system settings.

With these roles, Manoa Bites enables users to find relevant food choices based on personal preferences while allowing vendors to share up-to-date menu information with the campus community.

**Team Members**  
We’re a team of five dedicated developers passionate about enhancing the campus dining experience:

- **John Bernardo** - Role (e.g., Frontend Developer)
- **Leighton Miguel** - Role (e.g., Backend Developer)
- **Caleb Hopkins** - Role (e.g., UI/UX Designer)
- **Jingyu Huang** - Role (e.g., Database Specialist)
- **Pelita Felicitas** - Role (e.g., Project Manager)

Each team member brings a unique skill set to the project, helping us create a user-friendly and comprehensive food directory for the UH Manoa campus.
